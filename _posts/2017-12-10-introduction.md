Now that I a finished my bachelor degree in mathematics, it is time to return from the abstract world to reality. There is an old saying,<i> "If we use imaginary numbers in the real world, this this world real?"</i>. I'm here now to find out. In previous mouths I have been studying and experimenting in the art of machine learning. I suppose I was lucky to be alive at a time where information is so available, from Youtube to random blogs on the field.
I have already explored the basics of the theory. That is:
* Course by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ninamf/courses/601sp15/lectures.shtml">Tom Mitchell and Maria-Florina Balcan's course on machine learning</a>
* Course by <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Andrew Ng.</a>
* Course by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlhFWT7vAEw&list=PLE6Wd9FR--EfW8dtjAuPoTuPcqmOV53Fu">Nando de Freitas</a> on Deep learning.

These courses are great for theoretical knowledge, understanding the intuition, bounds, complexity, and generalization guarantees of many algorithms in use today.

One problem with them both though, neither of them Use <i>Python</i> as their programming language. Although this might be regard as a minor inconvenience, I believe that <i>Python</i> is the modern way to work. 
I found the "course" by <a href = "https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/" > Sentdex</a> to be sufficient to start with. In his course he implemented some of the algorithms "by hand", and introduced also introduced <a href = "http://scikit-learn.org">sk-learn</a> and <a href = "https://www.tensorflow.org" > Tensorflow</a>.
In addition, the youtube channel hosted by <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A" >Siraj Raval</a> introduce more modern ideas.
Now that i have finished playing with the basic projects, I believe that is time to work on state of the art concepts.

I specialized at geometry in my bachelor degree, there for I enjoy working with images. Tomorrow I shell right about <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network" > GAN</a>, and what I want to research on this topic.
